# Linear-models

Implementing Linear models from the ground up in C++ by using my Linear Algebra Framework as a starting point
- [ ] Multiple Linear Regression \n
      - Implemented using Normal Equations (but they were unstable for large datasets when computing inverse)
      - QR Decomposition
- [ ] Ridge Regression
- [ ] Lasso Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
